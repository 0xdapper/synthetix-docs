			"description": "This contract is a type of Service Locator pattern that allows for easier interaction between multiple contracts. Instead of contract A needing references to contracts B and C (and updating ever release), contract A can refer to an AddressResolver and query for B and C at transaction time. Then, during a release, the AddressResolver is updated with the latest B and C contarct. Thus this ensures that contract A always has the latest B and C contracts."

So: a) this will only work with `sUSD`. b) there's a profit opportunity if the `sUSD` is off its peg.\r\n\r\n!!!
