# Integrations

Here is a list of Synthetix Integrations on and offchain. For projects wishing to integate with Synthetix please see the technical [Integration guide](/contracts/integration/)

- **The Graph**: [The Graph](http://thegraph.com/) is a decentralised indexer and GraphQL query engine of blockchain events and function calls. Synthetix has a number of subgraphs tracking a number of events and key metrics within the system historically. For more information on how to query or subscribe to events in real time see [Historical Data](historical-data.md).
- **UniSwap:** [Uniswap](https://uniswap.io/) is a decentralised exchange for exchanging ETH and ERC20 tokens. Synthetix integrates with it to deepen the Synthetix ecosystem's liquidity, and it acts as an on-ramp/off-ramp for the Synth market. Users who provide liquidity to the [ETH/sETH pool](https://uniswap.exchange/swap/0x42456D7084eacF4083f1140d3229471bbA2949A8) are provided with staking rewards as [part of the Synthetix protocol](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-8). This is discussed further [here](https://blog.synthetix.io/uniswap-seth-pool-incentives/), [here](https://blog.synthetix.io/snx-arbitrage-pool/), and [here](https://blog.synthetix.io/new-uniswap-seth-lp-reward-system/).
- **KyberSwap:** Liquidity is further deepened by the integration of SNX and sUSD with [KyberSwap](https://kyberswap.com/swap/eth-snx), which is built on the [Kyber Network Protocol](https://kyber.network/). An example use case is described [here](https://blog.synthetix.io/snx-liquidity-has-been-added-to-kyberswap/).
- **Curve:**
